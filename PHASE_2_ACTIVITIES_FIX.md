# Phase 2 Fix - Account Activities Association Error

## Issue

**Error:** `NoMethodError: undefined method 'account_activities' for #<Account>`

**Location:** AI Insights endpoint when loading account data

**Root Cause:** Incorrect association name used in controller. The Account model has `activities`, not `account_activities`.

---

## The Fix

Changed all references from `account_activities` to `activities` in the AccountsController.

### Changes Made:

**File:** `app/controllers/api/v1/accounts_controller.rb`

1. **insights action** - Line 298:
```ruby
# BEFORE
activities = @account.account_activities.order(created_at: :desc).limit(20)

# AFTER  
activities = @account.activities.order(created_at: :desc).limit(20)
```

2. **calculate_activity_score helper** - Line 484:
```ruby
# BEFORE
activities = account.account_activities.where('created_at > ?', 30.days.ago)

# AFTER
activities = account.activities.where('created_at > ?', 30.days.ago)
```

3. **generate_recommendations helper** - Line 539:
```ruby
# BEFORE
pending = account.account_activities.where(status: 'pending').count

# AFTER
pending = account.activities.where(status: 'pending').count
```

---

## Why This Happened

The Account model defines the association as:
```ruby
has_many :activities, class_name: 'AccountActivity', dependent: :destroy
```

The association is named `activities`, even though the model is `AccountActivity`. This is a common Rails pattern to keep association names simple.

## Status

âœ… **FIXED** - All references now use correct association name

The AI Insights endpoint should now work without errors!

---

## Test It

1. Restart your Rails server (if needed)
2. Navigate to an account in the UI
3. Click "AI Insights" tab
4. Should load without errors! ðŸŽ‰

## Files Modified

- `app/controllers/api/v1/accounts_controller.rb` - Fixed 3 references to activities association

---

**Now it should actually work!** The association name mismatch has been corrected.
