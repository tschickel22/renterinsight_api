# 🎯 FOUND THE ISSUE! - Quick Fix

## ❌ The Problem

From your logs:
```
SMS send failed: uninitialized constant SmsService::Twilio
```

**The `twilio-ruby` gem is not installed!**

That's why:
- ✅ Email works (no gem needed)
- ✅ Your Platform SMS test works (different system)
- ❌ Password reset SMS fails (needs the gem)

---

## ✅ The Solution (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Install the gem
```bash
cd ~/src/renterinsight_api
bash install_twilio.sh
```

OR manually:
```bash
cd ~/src/renterinsight_api
bundle install
```

### Step 2: Restart Rails server
```bash
# Kill current server
pkill -f puma

# Restart
bin/rails server -p 3001
```

### Step 3: Test SMS again
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/request_password_reset \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone":"303-570-9810","delivery_method":"sms","user_type":"client"}'
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Reset instructions sent successfully","delivery_method":"sms"}
```

And you should receive an SMS on your phone: `303-570-9810`

## 📊 What Your Logs Show

### ✅ Everything is Working Correctly!

1. **Phone normalized:** `303-570-9810` → `+13035709810` ✅
2. **User found:** Client #7 found ✅
3. **Token created:** Password reset token created ✅
4. **Settings loaded:** Platform SMS settings loaded ✅
5. **Configuration correct:**
   ```
   ✅ Using Platform SMS settings
   📱 SMS Configuration:
      Provider: twilio
      Account SID: AC0576a5bc...
      Auth Token: [SET]
      From Number: +1 720 575 2095
      To Number: +13035709810

6. **Only problem:** `uninitialized constant SmsService::Twilio`
   - This means the gem isn't installed
   - Nothing wrong with your config!
