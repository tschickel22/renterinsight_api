# Testing Activity Notifications

## What I Fixed

### Issue 1: Activity Log Validation Error ‚úÖ
**Problem:** The `Activity` model didn't recognize `lead_activity_reminder` as a valid activity type.

**Fix:** Added these types to `Activity` model:
- `lead_activity_task`
- `lead_activity_meeting`
- `lead_activity_call`
- `lead_activity_reminder`

### Issue 2: Reminders Don't Reschedule on Update ‚úÖ
**Problem:** When you edit an existing reminder's time, it didn't reschedule the notification.

**Fix:** Added `after_update` callback that:
1. Detects when `reminder_time` changes
2. Resets the `reminder_sent` flag
3. Reschedules the reminder job

## How to Test Popup Notifications

### Step 1: Make Sure Frontend is Connected
You need to add the notification hook to your app. 

**Where to add it:** In your main App layout or CRM component

**File:** `src/App.tsx` or `src/modules/crm-prospecting/CRMProspecting.tsx`

**Add this code:**
```typescript
import { useActivityNotifications } from '@/hooks/useActivityNotifications';
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth'; // or wherever your auth is

function YourComponent() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  // This connects to ActionCable and shows toast notifications
  useActivityNotifications({
    userId: user?.id,
    onNotification: (data) => {
      console.log('üì¢ Received notification:', data);
    }
  });

  return (
    // your JSX
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Test Creating a Reminder

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Go to CRM > Create a new reminder**
   - Set reminder time to **1 minute from now**
   - Check "Popup" in reminder methods
3. **Watch the console** - you should see:
   - `[ActivityNotifications] Connected to notifications channel`
   - After 1 minute: `üì¢ Received notification: ...`
4. **Watch the screen** - a toast notification should appear

### Step 3: Test Editing a Reminder

1. **Edit an existing reminder**
2. **Change the reminder time** to 1 minute from now
3. **Save**
4. **Watch for popup** after 1 minute

### Step 4: Verify in Rails Logs

**Watch Rails server output:**
```bash
tail -f log/development.log | grep -E "ActivityNotification|ActionCable|Reminder"
```

**You should see:**
```
[LeadActivity] Scheduled reminder job for activity 123 in 60 seconds
[ActivityReminderJob] Sending reminders for activity 123
[ActivityNotification] Broadcast popup for activity 123 to user 1
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Popup Appears

**Check 1: Is ActionCable Connected?**
Open browser console, look for:
```
[ActivityNotifications] Connected to notifications channel
```

If not connected:
- Check Rails server is running on port 3001
- Check WebSocket URL in hook: `ws://localhost:3001/cable`
- Check CORS settings in `config/environments/development.rb`

**Check 2: Are Notifications Enabled?**
Check settings:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/company/settings | jq '.notifications.popup'
```

Should show:
```json
{
  "isEnabled": true,
  "showReminders": true,
  "showActivityUpdates": true
}
```

**Check 3: Is Reminder Being Sent?**
Check Rails logs:
```bash
tail -f log/development.log | grep "ActivityReminderJob"
```

Should see job executing at the scheduled time.

### Validation Error Still Appears

If you still see "Activity type is not included in the list":
```bash
cd /home/tschi/src/renterinsight_api
bundle exec rails console

# Check what types are valid
Activity::VALID_TYPES

# Should include: "lead_activity_reminder"
```

If not, restart Rails server:
```bash
bundle exec rails s -p 3001
```

## Quick Test Script

Want to test immediately without waiting? Run this in Rails console:

```ruby
# In Rails console (rails c)
activity = LeadActivity.find(YOUR_ACTIVITY_ID)
ActivityNotificationService.new(activity).send_popup_notification
```

Then check browser - you should see a toast notification immediately!

## What Happens When Reminder Fires

1. **ActivityReminderJob** runs at scheduled time
2. **ActivityNotificationService** checks settings
3. If popup enabled ‚Üí **Broadcasts via ActionCable**
4. **Frontend hook** receives broadcast
5. **Toast notification** appears with:
   - Activity icon (üìã task, üìÖ meeting, üìû call, ‚è∞ reminder)
   - Subject
   - Description
   - "View Lead" button (if leadId present)
   - Auto-closes after `autoCloseDelay` ms (default 5000)

## Expected Behavior

‚úÖ Create reminder ‚Üí Notification scheduled  
‚úÖ Edit reminder time ‚Üí Notification rescheduled  
‚úÖ Reminder fires ‚Üí Popup appears (if enabled)  
‚úÖ Multiple methods ‚Üí All selected methods fire (email, SMS, popup)  
‚úÖ Settings disabled ‚Üí No notification sent

---

**Everything should work now! The validation error is fixed and reminders will reschedule when you edit them.** üéâ
