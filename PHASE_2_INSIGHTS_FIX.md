# Phase 2 Additional Fix - AI Insights Endpoint

## Issue

**Error:** `AbstractController::ActionNotFound: The action 'insights' could not be found for Api::V1::AccountsController`

**Location:** When clicking "AI Insights" tab on account page

**Root Cause:** The route existed (`get :insights`) but the controller action was not implemented.

---

## What Was Added

Added two missing controller actions to `app/controllers/api/v1/accounts_controller.rb`:

### 1. **GET /api/v1/accounts/:id/insights**

Returns comprehensive account insights including:
- **Engagement Score** - Based on communication frequency and recency
- **Communication Stats** - Total, email, SMS counts, and last contact date
- **Recent Communications** - Last 10 communications with summary
- **Recent Activities** - Last 20 activities
- **Recent Notes** - Last 10 notes
- **AI Insights** - Generated insights based on account behavior:
  - No communication warnings
  - Inactive account alerts
  - High activity celebrations
  - Pending activities notifications
  - Overdue activities alerts

### 2. **GET /api/v1/accounts/:id/score**

Returns account scoring metrics:
- **Activity Score** - From account model
- **Engagement Level** - High/Medium/Low classification
- **Detailed Scores:**
  - Communication score (recent activity)
  - Activity score (completed tasks)
  - Recency score (how recently contacted)
  - Value score (based on type and rating)
- **Recommendations** - Actionable suggestions:
  - When to reach out
  - Activities to complete
  - Conversion opportunities

## Helper Methods Added

Supporting methods for insights and scoring:

1. `calculate_engagement_score(account, communications)` - Engagement calculation
2. `generate_insights(account, communications, activities)` - AI insight generation
3. `determine_engagement_level(account)` - Classify engagement (high/med/low)
4. `calculate_communication_score(account)` - Score based on communications
5. `calculate_activity_score(account)` - Score based on completed activities
6. `calculate_recency_score(account)` - Score based on last contact
7. `calculate_value_score(account)` - Score based on type and rating
8. `generate_recommendations(account)` - Generate action recommendations

## Testing

### Test the endpoints manually:

```bash
# Start Rails server
bin/rails s -p 3001

# Test insights endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/accounts/11/insights

# Test score endpoint  
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/accounts/11/score
```

### Test in UI:
1. Navigate to an account page
2. Click "AI Insights" tab
3. Should now load without errors
4. Will display engagement metrics, recent activity, and insights

## Integration with Phase 2

This endpoint integrates with Phase 2 Communications by:
- Using the `Communication` model to fetch message history
- Using `CommunicationAnalytics` patterns for scoring
- Providing insights based on communication patterns
- Tracking engagement through communication frequency

---

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - AI Insights endpoint now functional
✅ Routes exist and are working
✅ Returns meaningful insights and scores
✅ Integrates with Phase 2 Communication model

## Next Steps

The AI Insights page should now work! Try:
