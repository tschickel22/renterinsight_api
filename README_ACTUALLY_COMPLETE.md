# Phase 2 ACTUALLY Complete Now! 🎉

## All 4 Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Test Failures (5 tests)
- ✅ Scheduled stats query
- ✅ Webhook double updates (4 tests)

### 2. Messages Endpoint
- ✅ `CommunicationLog` → `Communication`

### 3. Insights Endpoint  
- ✅ Added `insights` action
- ✅ Added `score` action

### 4. Activities Association ⭐ **JUST FIXED**
- ✅ `account_activities` → `activities`

---

## The Latest Fix

**Problem:** Used wrong association name  
**Error:** `undefined method 'account_activities'`  
**Solution:** Changed to correct name: `activities`

### What Was Wrong:
```ruby
# Account model has:
has_many :activities, class_name: 'AccountActivity'

# But controller was using:
@account.account_activities  # ❌ WRONG

# Should be:
@account.activities  # ✅ CORRECT
```

### Fixed in 3 places:
1. `insights` action
2. `calculate_activity_score` helper  
3. `generate_recommendations` helper
