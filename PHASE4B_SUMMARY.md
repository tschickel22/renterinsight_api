## 🔌 API Endpoints

### 1. List Quotes
```
GET /api/portal/quotes
```
- Requires JWT authentication
- Returns paginated list of buyer's quotes
- Supports status filtering
- Default 20 per page, max 100
- Ordered by newest first

### 2. Show Quote
```
GET /api/portal/quotes/:id
```
- Requires JWT authentication
- Returns full quote details with items
- Auto-marks as "viewed" on first access
- Includes vehicle and account info

### 3. Accept Quote
```
POST /api/portal/quotes/:id/accept
```
- Requires JWT authentication
- Accepts quotes with status 'sent' or 'viewed'
- Validates expiration
- Creates activity note
- Updates status to 'accepted'

### 4. Reject Quote
```
POST /api/portal/quotes/:id/reject
```
- Requires JWT authentication
- Rejects quotes with status 'sent' or 'viewed'
- Validates expiration
- Creates activity note with reason
- Updates status to 'rejected'

---

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **JWT Authentication**
   - All endpoints require valid JWT token
   - Returns 401 if not authenticated

2. **Authorization**
   - Buyers can only access their own quotes
   - Lead buyers: quotes linked via converted_account_id
   - Account buyers: quotes linked directly
   - Returns 403 for unauthorized access

3. **Data Protection**
   - Soft-deleted quotes hidden from buyers
   - Validation on all state transitions
   - Prevents actions on expired quotes

4. **Audit Trail**
   - Notes created for all accept/reject actions
   - Includes buyer name and details
   - Timestamps on all actions

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 36+
- **Controller Tests**: 25+
- **Presenter Tests**: 11
- **Code Coverage**: All endpoints and edge cases

### Test Scenarios

#### Happy Path
- ✅ List quotes for Lead buyer
- ✅ List quotes for Account buyer
- ✅ Filter by status
- ✅ Pagination
- ✅ View quote details
- ✅ Mark as viewed
- ✅ Accept sent quote
- ✅ Accept viewed quote
- ✅ Reject sent quote
- ✅ Reject viewed quote
- ✅ Create notes on actions

#### Edge Cases
- ✅ No authentication
- ✅ Invalid token
- ✅ Other buyer's quote
- ✅ Non-existent quote
- ✅ Deleted quote
- ✅ Already accepted quote
- ✅ Already rejected quote
- ✅ Draft quote
- ✅ Expired quote
- ✅ Invalid items format
- ✅ Nil values

---

## 💡 Business Rules Implemented

1. **Status Transitions**
   - Draft → Sent → Viewed → Accepted/Rejected
   - Can only accept/reject from Sent or Viewed
   - Expired quotes cannot be accepted/rejected

2. **Viewing Behavior**
   - First view of 'sent' quote marks as 'viewed'
   - Subsequent views don't change timestamp
   - Draft quotes don't auto-update

3. **Authorization Rules**
   - Lead buyers need is_converted=true
   - Lead buyers need converted_account_id set
   - Account buyers have direct access
   - Cross-buyer access forbidden

4. **Data Visibility**
   - Only non-deleted quotes shown
   - Only buyer's own quotes accessible
   - Expired quotes visible but not actionable
